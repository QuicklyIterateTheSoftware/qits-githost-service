/**
 * A git repository stored in a blob store and a catalog, with no directory anywhere.
 *
 * <p>It is a {@code Repository}, so {@code UploadPack} and {@code ReceivePack} serve it unchanged —
 * clone, fetch, push, push options and hooks all behave as they do over a bare on a disk. Build one
 * with {@link QitsDfsRepositoryBuilder}.
 *
 * <p>Two things it is <b>not</b>, both of which have caught someone already:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The git CLI cannot open it.</b> There is no directory to point {@code --git-dir} at, no
 *       worktree to add, no config file to write. Every operation on a repository stored this way is
 *       either the wire protocol or in-process JGit; there is no third door. That property is the
 *       point — the only writers are receive-pack and the host's own in-process code, so nothing
 *       changes a ref behind the host's back and every move can be announced.
 *   <li><b>{@link #getConfig()} does not persist.</b> {@code DfsRepository} answers with a {@code
 *       DfsConfig}, whose load and save are no-ops, so a per-repository setting written there is
 *       forgotten immediately and read back as the platform default. Anything that was a line in a
 *       bare's {@code config} needs a row somewhere else.
 * </ul>
