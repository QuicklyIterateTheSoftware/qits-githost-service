/**
 * A branch is gone: this repository no longer has {@code branch}, which last pointed at {@code
 * sha}.
 *
 * <p><b>New. A deletion reached nobody before.</b> The post-receive fan-out skipped every {@code
 * DELETE} command, so a merged feature branch disappeared silently and a consumer holding state per
 * branch — a run history, a mirror, a dashboard row — had no way to learn it should stop.
 *
 * <p>{@code sha} is the OLD tip: the commit the branch pointed at when the delete arrived. It is
 * the only thing left to name the branch by, and it is what lets a consumer tell "the branch I knew
 * about" from one that had already moved on.
 *
 * <p>{@code projectId} and {@code repoName} are the address the push arrived on, echoed and not
 * resolved, and null for a push on the internal {@code /git/<storageId>} scheme — see {@link
 * SCMPublishCommit} for the whole of that rule.
