/**
 * The in-process git smart-HTTP server, mounted at {@code /git/*} so workspace containers
 * can clone and push over {@code http://<qits-host>:<port>/git/<repoId>}.
 *
 * <p>Implemented as plain Vert.x routes driving JGit's {@link UploadPack}/{@link ReceivePack}
 * directly — deliberately NOT as a servlet. qits used to host this with JGit's {@code GitServlet}
 * on {@code quarkus-undertow}; that dependency broke the SPA the host used to share a process with,
 * and it has stayed out since. Raw routes are also what keeps the wire protocol the whole of what
 * this class does.
 *
 * <p>Every Git route requires {@code qits:admin} from an authenticated browser session, {@code
 * qits:system} from a machine token, {@code qits:git:external} from a workstation token, or {@code
 * qits:agent} / {@code qits:ci-run} from a commissioned agent or CI run. The role only opens the
 * door; what a push may touch is {@link RefScopeHook}'s. Repository ids remain identifiers, not
 * capabilities.
 * JGit here speaks the wire protocol and nothing else, and receive-pack is the
 * only writer this host has — a repository has no directory anyone could run git in.
 *
 * <p>Two things a push is checked against, in this order:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link RefScopeHook}: which refs this credential may push. A credential with a {@code
 *       git_refs} list pushes only those refs; a workstation token and a person push only {@code
 *       refs/heads/external/*}; a client token without a scope pushes nothing unless it holds
 *       {@code qits:system}, and then it is not restricted. Roles do not widen a scope. The scope
 *       is captured on the event loop ({@link #snapshotPushScope}).
 *   <li>{@link ProtectedRefHook}, the default branch's seatbelt. It is not an authorization system
 *       — it guards exactly one ref per repo (the bare's {@code HEAD}) against a reflex {@code git
 *       push … main}, and it ships inert. See that class for the mechanism, the two push-option
 *       bypasses and why they are options rather than headers.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Two addressing schemes, and they are not two ways of saying the same thing:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>name-addressed</b> {@code /git/:projectId/:repoName} — <b>the public clone url</b>, and
 *       the only address anything above the projects↔githost seam ever holds: CI, the daemons, a
 *       deploy push, a human. {@code repoName} is resolved through the {@link
 *       RepositoryNameResolver} port to a storage id, and {@code (projectId, repoName)} is what a
 *       push then ECHOES onto its events — this host resolves a name per request and remembers
 *       none. It is also what lets committed relative submodule urls ({@code ../<name>.git}) resolve
 *       natively against a sibling, with no {@code submodule.<name>.url} override. With no resolver
 *       on the classpath, or none configured, the scheme answers 404.
 *   <li><b>id-addressed</b> {@code /git/:repoId} — the opaque storage id, handed straight to the
 *       store. <b>Internal plumbing for qits-projects</b>, which mints that id and is the one
 *       service that may speak it; a UUID clone url is never published and never leaks upward. When
 *       {@code qits.githost.storage-client} names the projects service's client, every route of this
 *       scheme demands the role {@code clients/<that client>} and nothing else opens it — see
 *       {@link #storageSchemeRefused}. The two <b>content reads</b> take one further list, {@code
 *       qits.githost.content-readers}, and nothing else does — see {@link #contentReaders}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The three smart-HTTP endpoints hang off each scheme:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code GET …/info/refs?service=git-(upload|receive)-pack} — the ref advertisement.
 *   <li>{@code POST …/git-upload-pack} — fetch/clone negotiation + packfile.
 *   <li>{@code POST …/git-receive-pack} — push.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Beside those, four lifecycle routes on the id-addressed base only — not served
 * name-addressed, since a name is an alias for an id that has to already exist:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code PUT …/:repoId} {@code {"defaultBranch": "main"}} — create, idempotently: 201 when
 *       this call created the repository, 200 when one was already there.
 *   <li>{@code GET …/:repoId} — {@code {"repoId", "defaultBranch"}} for a repository that exists,
 *       404 otherwise.
 *   <li>{@code HEAD …/:repoId} — the same existence question with no body.
 *   <li>{@code DELETE …/:repoId} — delete the repository: 204 when it existed and its rows are
 *       gone, 404 when this host holds no such repository. No body either way.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These give a caller (qits-projects) a way to provision a repository over the wire instead of
 * {@code git init --bare} on the shared volume — see {@code projects-volume-decoupling-plan.md}
 * §2. The delete verb, withheld while the plan was written, is the same argument run the other way:
 * qits-projects deletes repository rows, and without a verb here every one of them left a bare
 * behind at an id nobody holds any more.
 *
 * <p>And one route on the bare collection:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code GET /git} — {@code {"repositories": ["<repoId>", …]}}, every repository
 *       this host serves, sorted lexicographically.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>That listing was withheld on purpose while nothing needed it (the same plan's §2.1, "no
 * enumerate verb"); the decision is reversed rather than left standing, because a caller that cannot
 * ask has to be told out of band by whoever creates a repository. It answers STORAGE ids, so it is
 * part of the id-addressed scheme and guarded with it — a caller enumerating repositories to act on
 * them wants qits-projects' listing, which answers names. It is one segment shorter than every route
 * above it, so it shadows none of them.
 *
 * <p>And two <b>content reads</b>, served on <b>both</b> schemes:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code GET …/:repoId/blob/:rev/<path>} and {@code GET …/:projectId/:repoName/blob/:rev/
 *       <path>} — the raw bytes at that path in that revision.
 *   <li>{@code GET …/:repoId/tree/:rev[/<path>]} and {@code GET …/:projectId/:repoName/tree/:rev[/
 *       <path>]} — {@code {"entries":[{"name","type"}]}} for the directory there; no path is the
 *       root tree. A submodule gitlink is typed {@code commit} and carries the {@code sha} it pins.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The wire protocol has no blob-at-path verb, so a consumer that wanted one file had to keep a
 * local clone and re-fetch it. Both routes answer at any revision the repository holds — a full sha
 * as readily as a branch name — which is what lets a post-receive consumer read the exact pushed
 * commit instead of racing the branch, and both carry the resolved commit in {@value
 * #COMMIT_SHA_HEADER}. They are reads, but follow the same Git HTTP authentication policy as every
 * other route here. The name-addressed pair is what lets qits-ci read a pipeline config and
 * qits-deployments read a deploy spec without ever holding a storage id.

   * <p><b>Why the content reads and not the scheme</b>, which is the whole of the reasoning

   * qits-projects" rather than "the caller is privileged", and every route that CLONES, PUSHES,

   * read name-addressed — the file, at the revision, of a repository it was told about. What it
   * needs the id for is that the caller was handed an id and no name: qits-deployments reads a
   * released repository's {@code .config/qits/deployments.yml} out of a {@code SoftwareRelease},
   * whose repository coordinate is the storage id (the name pair is newer than the event and still
   * absent from the ones already in the log). Refusing that read is the platform's own deployer
   * being told to stop holding an address nothing else offered it — measured on 2026-09-04 as
   * thirteen {@code deployment spec unreadable … the git host answered 403} rows, one per release,
   * each one a deployment that had to be replayed by hand.
   *
   * <p><b>The 403 was also the wrong SHAPE of answer</b>, which is why this is a fix rather than a
   * grant. The deployer reads name-addressed first and falls back to the id url on a 404, so a
   * refusal here surfaced as a 403 on a read whose real story was "there is no such name" — a
   * status a caller cannot act on, in place of one it can.
   *
   * <p><b>Unset is today's behaviour, byte for byte</b>, and an empty value is unset: the content
   * reads then demand the storage client's self-role like every other id-addressed route. A value
   * naming a role broader than one client — {@code qits:system} is the live one — is a deliberate
   * widening and should be read as such: it says every machine on the platform may read a blob by
   * storage id, and still nothing more.
   *
   * <p>An {@code Optional}, never a {@code List} with an empty default, for the reason
   * {@link #storageClient} states: SmallRye reads a configured-empty value as absent, and a

   * does not resolve, and when the path resolves to something that is not a tree.
   *
   * <p>{@code type} is {@code tree}, {@code blob} or {@code commit}. A symlink is listed as {@code
   * blob}, because what a caller does with an entry is descend into it or read it, and a symlink is
   * read. A <b>submodule gitlink</b> is neither: it is a pointer, and it is the one entry kind whose
   * value is not its bytes but the sha it names. So a gitlink — and only a gitlink — carries two
   * more fields, {@code sha} (the commit it pins, 40 hex) and {@code mode} ({@code "160000"}), and
   * its {@code type} is git's own name for that entry, {@code commit}.
   *
   * <p>The consumer is qits-platform-maintenance, which scans gitlink pins: a pin's version <i>is</i>
   * the sha of the mode-160000 entry, and its {@code GitHostReader} reads both {@code sha} and
   * {@code mode}/{@code type} off this answer, pinning nothing (with a WARN) when they are absent.
   * The fields stay gitlink-only rather than going on every entry: a sha on each blob and tree would
   * be uniform but would grow every listing of a big directory for readers that never asked, and no
   * caller has needed a blob's object id — the {@code blob} route addresses content by path, not by
   * id. A reader that switches on {@code type} keeps working: nothing that was {@code tree} or
   * {@code blob} moved, only the gitlinks that used to collapse into {@code blob}.
   *
   * <p>Descending into a gitlink stays a 404 on both this route and the blob route, which is the
   * truth: the submodule's objects live in another repository and this one holds none of them. The
   * {@code sha} on the entry is the whole answer about a gitlink — read the pinned repository at
   * that sha to go further.
   *
   * <p>The order is the tree's own — git's canonical sort — so it is stable across revisions without
   * this route sorting anything.
