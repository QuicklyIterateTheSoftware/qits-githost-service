/**
 * The default branch's seatbelt: it builds a {@link PreReceiveHook} that refuses a direct update or
 * delete of whatever {@code HEAD} points at, so that releasing becomes something the platform does
 * (through qits-workspaces' integrate endpoint) rather than something a person remembers to do.
 *
 * <p><b>This is not a lock and must not pretend to be one.</b> What it guards against is reflex:
 * the muscle memory of {@code git push …/git/<repo> main} that every doc in this tree
 * taught first. There used to be a second door beside it — anything with the {@code
 * qits-repositories} volume mounted moved a ref by writing a file — and that volume is gone, so
 * receive-pack, and therefore this hook, is now on the only path in.
 *
 * <p>Why a Java hook and not a {@code hooks/pre-receive} script: this host runs no git. {@link
 * GitHostRoutes} drives JGit's {@link ReceivePack} in-process from raw Vert.x routes — no CGI, no
 * {@code git http-backend}, no subprocess — so a script in the bare's {@code hooks/} would never
 * execute and {@code GIT_PUSH_OPTION_*} is not a concept on this path. JGit hands the options to
 * this hook directly, as {@link ReceivePack#getPushOptions()}.
 *
 * <h2>What is protected</h2>
 *
 * <p>The protected ref is {@link Repository#getFullBranch()} — the repository's own {@code HEAD}.
 * That is {@code refs/heads/main} for every repository here, it is per-repo with nothing to keep in
 * step, it needs no cross-service read of qits-projects' {@code Repository.mainBranch}, and it is
 * semantically the right answer ("the repo's default branch") rather than a hardcoded string. It is
 * also the one thing that survived the move to DFS untouched: under reftable {@code HEAD} is a
 * symbolic ref in the ref database like any other. Every other ref is untouched: this is a guard on
 * one branch, not an authorization system.
 *
 * <p><b>Creates are allowed.</b> An empty repository has no default branch to protect and blocking
 * its seeding push buys no safety — which is also what keeps {@code qits-local-up.sh}'s first-run
 * push working with no option at all. Updates and deletes of the protected ref are guarded.
 *
 * <h2>The two bypasses, and a third option that is not one</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code -o qits.release} — "this is an integrate-produced release". <b>Fast-forward only</b>,
 *       which is what bounds it: the integrate flow's push is a compare-and-swap, and granting it
 *       force would defeat that. Not a secret; it is the sanctioned domain door.
 *   <li>{@code -o qits.token=<value>} — "push anyway", allowing any update including a
 *       non-fast-forward and a delete, <b>iff</b> the value equals {@code
 *       qits.repositories.git.push-token}. That property has <b>no default: unset means no token
 *       matches</b>, and a configured-empty value likewise matches nothing (never "empty allows
 *       empty"). With protection on and no token configured, direct pushes to the default branch
 *       are simply impossible, and a deployment that wants the dev-loop escape configures one.
 *       <b>Only a platform service client may use it</b> — a client token with {@code qits:system}
 *       and no push scope (rule 4 of {@link RefScopeHook}). A person, a workstation and a credential
 *       with {@code git_refs} are refused even with the right value, so knowing the value is not
 *       enough.
 *   <li>{@code -o qits.no-ci} — <b>not</b> a bypass of this hook, and this class never reads it: it
 *       rides through to {@code SCMPublishCommit.suppressCi}, where each consumer decides what it
 *       means ({@code GitHostRoutes.service}'s post-receive lambda, {@code ScmEventAnnouncer}). It
 *       grants no write this pusher did not already have — a push that could carry it could equally
 *       push nothing at all — so it needs no gate of its own. Named here because it rides the same
 *       push-options channel as the two bypasses above and is easy to look for in the wrong class.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Push options rather than a header, because a header cannot serve all three doors this host is
 * reachable through: qits-gateway strips the whole {@code X-Qits-} prefix unconditionally, so an
 * {@code X-Qits-Force-Push} would be present on qits-net and absent through the front door — a
 * bypass whose behaviour depends on which url you used. Options ride inside the pack protocol and
 * are identical through every door.
 *
 * <p>Both bypasses are logged at INFO when they are accepted, the token value never echoed, so "how
 * much direct-to-main pushing is still happening" stays a question with an answer.
 *
 * <h2>Turning it on</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code qits.repositories.git.protect-default-branch} is the platform-wide switch and ships
 * <b>false</b>: a host that refuses pushes is the host that serves its own redeploy, so this shipped
 * inert and is flipped once every legitimate pusher has been taught the options. The per-repo
 * override is a row, {@link RepositoryProtectionStore}.
 *
 * <p>It was {@code [qits] protectDefaultBranch} in the bare's own config, read straight off the
 * repository JGit had already opened. That reading has no future: a DFS-backed repository has no
 * config file at all — {@code DfsRepository.getConfig()} is an in-memory {@code DfsConfig} whose
 * load and save are no-ops — so the call would have answered the platform default for every
 * repository with no symptom anywhere. The row replaces it for <b>both</b> backends rather than only
 * the new one: one question with two answer sources is a question that eventually gets two answers.
 *
 * <p>The hook is therefore <b>bound to a repo id</b> before it is installed ({@link
 * #forRepository}). {@code GitHostRoutes} already knows the id it resolved; deriving it from the
 * repository's directory would work on one backend and return nothing on the other.
 *
 * <p>JGit's own {@code validateCommands()} runs <i>before</i> this hook and is what makes
 * fast-forward detection reliable here: by the time a command reaches {@link #onPreReceive} its type
 * is already refined to {@code UPDATE} or {@code UPDATE_NONFASTFORWARD}.
