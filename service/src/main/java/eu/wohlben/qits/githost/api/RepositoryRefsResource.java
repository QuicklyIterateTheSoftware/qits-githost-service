/**
 * {@code POST /githost/api/repositories/{repoId}/{merges|tags|commits}} and {@code DELETE
 * …/branches/{name}} — the git primitives the platform's release flow is orchestrated out of, and
 * the first writes this host performs that are not a push.
 *
 * <h2>Primitives, not a release flow</h2>
 *
 * <p>Everything here speaks <b>refs, shas and paths</b>. There is no "release" in any name, no
 * version, no branch naming convention, no notion of what a {@code release/…} ref is for: the
 * caller (qits-projects) owns that vocabulary and this host owns the git. A primitive that knew
 * what it was being used for would have to be changed the next time the flow changed, and this
 * service exists precisely so that it does not.
 *
 * <h2>In-core, against the bare</h2>
 *
 * <p>No worktree, no clone, no checkout — a {@code QitsDfsRepository} has no directory to put one
 * in, and the git CLI cannot open it at all. Every operation is JGit in-process: the merge is
 * {@link MergeStrategy#RECURSIVE}'s in-core merger, the objects go through one {@link
 * ObjectInserter}, and the ref moves through the reftable database. Nothing touches a disk that is
 * not the blob store.
 *
 * <h2>These writes do not fire post-receive</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>Stated because it inverts a property this storage was built for.</b> {@code
 * QitsDfsRepository}'s javadoc says receive-pack is the only writer, so nothing changes a ref
 * without firing {@code post-receive} — and therefore without publishing {@code SCMPublishCommit}
 * and friends. These endpoints are a second writer, and they publish <b>nothing</b>. That is the
 * design and not an oversight: the caller is a domain service that is already narrating what it is
 * doing (a release request changed, a release happened), and an {@code SCMPublishCommit} for every
 * intermediate merge of a release request would announce steps nobody outside qits-projects has any
 * business reacting to. A consumer that wants to know a release happened listens for {@code
 * SCMRelease}, which its publisher emits.
 *
 * <h2>The guard</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #MACHINE_ROLE} and nothing else. The {@code githost-browse} HTTP policy already stands
 * in front of every path under {@code /githost/api/repositories/*} and answers an anonymous caller
 * with a 401; the annotation narrows what passes it to a <b>machine</b>. {@code qits:admin} — a
 * browser session, through the gateway's forwarded headers — is deliberately not enough: these are
 * primitives an orchestrator composes, and a half-composed release run from a browser tab is not a
 * thing anyone should be able to do by accident.
 *
 * <p>The one read, {@code GET …/branches/{name}}, also takes {@link #AGENT_ROLE}. Its method-level
 * annotation replaces the class-level one, so it names both roles.
 *
 * <h2>Native image</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every record below carries {@code @RegisterForReflection}, requests included. The responses
 * travel inside an untyped {@link Response}, so no build-time analysis of a method signature ever
 * sees them, and this service ships as a GraalVM binary where an unregistered entity is a 500 on
 * every answer while the whole JVM suite stays green (measured on the 2026.825.141202 deploy).

   * writes has four parents and the branch it was run on is the first of them. Here the target ref
   * plays HEAD — it is a head when it exists, and simply absent when the ref does not, which is
   * what makes the first call on a fresh {@code release/<id>} produce a plain N-parent octopus of
   * the sources alone.
   *
   * <p><b>A head another head already contains is dropped</b>, exactly as {@code git merge} answers
   * "Already up to date" for one. Two consequences fall out of that single rule, and they are the
   * whole of this endpoint's idempotency:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li><b>Nothing changed since the last merge → no new commit.</b> Every source is a parent of
   *       the target's tip, so every source is contained in it, so every source is dropped and the
   *       target is the only head left — which is the {@code unchanged} answer, with the same sha
   *       the previous call returned. Re-running a merge is free and leaves no garbage.
   *   <li><b>One effective head → no empty octopus.</b> If the survivor is the target, nothing
   *       moves; if it is a source (because the target is an ancestor of it), the ref fast-forwards
   *       onto it. A one-parent "merge" commit is never written.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><b>The fold is pairwise</b>, which is how git's own octopus strategy works: heads are merged
   * into an accumulator two at a time, and only the tree of the last fold is kept — the final
   * commit carries <b>all</b> the heads as parents, not a chain of two-parent merges. The
   * intermediate accumulators are real commits, written into the inserter so that the next fold's
   * merge base can be computed against the history merged so far (JGit's recursive merger does the
   * same thing for a criss-cross base). They are never referenced by any ref; on a conflict the
   * inserter is discarded without a flush and not one byte of any of it lands.
   *
   * <p><b>On a conflict no ref moves</b> and the answer is a 409 naming the paths and the head that
   * introduced each. Resolution is not this host's business — it has no worktree to resolve in and
   * no opinion about who should win.
   *
   * <p><b>Nothing here protects the target.</b> Merging into a repository's default branch is
   * allowed and is a designed use of this endpoint (a release reaches {@code main} only after it
   * deployed, and it reaches it through here). {@code ProtectedRefHook} guards the <i>push</i> door
   * against reflex; this door is only reachable by a machine that was asked for by name.
