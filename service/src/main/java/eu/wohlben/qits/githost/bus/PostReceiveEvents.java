/**
 * Turns one push into the events it means. The whole of the mapping, with no bus, no CDI and no
 * configuration in it — which is what lets the interesting half be tested by driving a real
 * repository rather than a container.
 *
 * <p>Four rules decide what comes out:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Only commands that ended {@code OK}.</b> A refused ref did not move; announcing it would
 *       have every consumer act on a push this host rejected. {@link ReceiveCommand#getResult()} is
 *       already final by the time a post-receive hook runs, so this is a read and not a guess.
 *   <li><b>Branches and tags, and nothing else.</b> {@code refs/heads/*} and {@code refs/tags/*}
 *       are the two namespaces the platform has a vocabulary for. A push that moves {@code
 *       refs/notes/*} or a ref of its own is silent rather than mapped onto the nearest word.
 *   <li><b>Delete is its own event.</b> The HTTP fan-out this replaces skipped deletions entirely,
 *       so a merged branch disappeared with nothing said.
 *   <li><b>Metadata comes from the repository, not from the wire.</b> The pack is already stored
 *       when this runs, so the head commit and the tag object can simply be read — which is the
 *       half the old {@code {repoId, branch, oldSha, newSha}} body never carried and every consumer
 *       had to fetch back.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A ref whose metadata cannot be read produces <b>no event</b> and one warning. That is the
 * conservative direction: an event with invented fields is worse than a missing one, and the miss
 * is visible in a log while a wrong author is not.
 *
 * <p>Every event carries the {@link Address} the push arrived on — the storage id it landed in plus,
 * when the pusher used the public scheme, the {@code (projectId, repoName)} it was addressed by.
 * Echoed and never resolved: this class asks nobody what a repository is called.
