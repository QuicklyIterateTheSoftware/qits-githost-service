 *
 * <p>The only implementation of {@link GitRepositoryProvider}. A second one, bare origins on a
 * shared volume, ran beside it for one release cycle and is gone — the volume with it.
 *
 * <p><b>The git CLI cannot open one of these.</b> There is no directory to point {@code --git-dir}
 * at, no worktree to add and no config file to write, so every operation on such a repository is
 * either the wire protocol or in-process JGit. That is the point rather than a limitation: the only
 * writers are receive-pack and the in-process REST doors, and neither moves a ref without announcing
 * it. It is also why the per-repository protection override had to become a row — {@code
 * DfsRepository.getConfig()} does not persist.
