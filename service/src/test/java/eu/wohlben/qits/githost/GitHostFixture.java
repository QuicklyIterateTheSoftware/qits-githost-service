 * class: each carries a profile that would change what the whole suite means, so they stay separate
 * and reach these helpers as statics.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here reads a directory</b>, because there is none to read. {@link #emptyOrigin} asks
 * {@link GitRepositoryProvider} to make a repository and every assertion after that goes over the
 * wire. Reading a served bare with {@code rev-parse} was the shortcut this suite was written away
 * from: a {@code DfsRepository} has no directory for the git CLI to open at all.
 *
 * <p>The git CLI rather than JGit's porcelain, for the same reason {@code GitHostTest} always shelled
 * it: what is under test is whether the real client can talk to this host, including the parts of
 * the protocol — push options among them — that only a real client negotiates.
 *
 * <p><b>Every git command presents {@link TestTokenMechanism#SERVICE_CLIENT}</b>, a client token
 * without a push scope, so the suite's pushes are restricted exactly as much as before C3. A test
 * about another credential names it with {@link #gitAs} or {@link #gitExpectingFailureAs}.
