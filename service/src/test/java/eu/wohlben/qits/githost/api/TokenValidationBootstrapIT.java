/**
 * The whole service as it is <b>packaged</b> — like the idp's {@code IdpPackagedSurfaceIT}, but
 * with the OIDC tenant <b>on</b>, which no {@code @QuarkusTest} here can prove: {@code %test}
 * disables the tenant outright, so the shipped {@code quarkus.oidc.*} block (auth-server-url +
 * jwks-path against a real listener, audience enforcement, groups→roles mapping) is exercised
 * nowhere else. The far side is {@link MockIdp}, whose recordings make the interaction assertable
 * on <b>both ends</b>.
 *
 * <p>It is also this repo's first <b>userflow</b>, and the {@code authentication} category's whole
 * content: the proof doubles as documentation, emitted under {@code target/userstories/} with a
 * network diagram beside the steps. The diagram is <b>observed, never narrated</b> — {@link
 * NetworkTaps#restAssured(String)} taps what a story sends into this service, {@link MockIdp}'s
 * recordings supply what this service sent to the idp, and the framework drains both at story end.
 * A story method therefore asserts and notes; it draws nothing. The story is browserless (no
 * {@code Flow} parameter), so no Chromium is involved anywhere.
 *
 * <p><b>The tap is the framework's now.</b> This class carried a hand-copied {@code
 * StoryNetworkFilter} — twenty lines four repositories each had a copy of — until qits-userflows
 * shipped {@link NetworkTaps}. The copy is deleted; the shipped tap takes the service name and
 * skips the same {@code /q/} segment, which is the right default here because this service's probe
 * root is {@code /githost/q} and the git wire at {@code /git} carries no such segment.
 *
 * <p><b>The profile below is the whole IT phase's.</b> Every story class in this module names it,
 * so failsafe launches the packaged process exactly once and the git stories under {@code
 * stories/} share this one's databases, idp and access log. That sharing is why the access-log tap
 * can attribute traffic at all — see {@link StoryAccessLog}.
 *
 * <p><b>The two stories are ordered</b>, and that is load-bearing rather than tidiness: a
 * cumulative source is attributed by a cursor, so traffic that happened before any story ran — the
 * startup JWKS fetch, which is the whole subject of the first story — lands in whichever story
 * drains <i>first</i>. Pinning the order is what keeps that the story it belongs to.

   * system properties, and expression expansion reads the whole config). The audience is not among
   * them: the shipped {@code quarkus.oidc.token.audience} is the platform audience and every token
   * a story mints carries it, so the packaged process enforces exactly what a deployment does.
   *
   * <p>The databases are the same embedded postgres the surefire suite spawns, under IT-own names
   * so nothing is shared with the {@code @QuarkusTest} databases. The two mocks start here — before
   * the application — via {@code ensureStarted()}, which parks their coordinates in system
   * properties: a test profile is instantiated in more than one classloader, and the property
   * table is the one thing every copy (and a story method's {@code attach()}) shares.
   *
   * <p><b>Three of the seams below exist for the git stories rather than for this class</b>, and
   * they live here because this is the profile every story class in the module names — one profile
   * means one launched process for the whole IT phase, which is what makes the access log a single
   * attributable recording:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>{@code qits.projects.name-resolver-url} — without it the PUBLIC clone url
   *       ({@code /git/:projectId/:repoName}) 404s and only the internal storage scheme serves, so
   *       not one git story could clone anything. {@link MockProjects} is the far end.
   *   <li>the {@code quarkus.http.access-log.*} block — the git stories' only possible network
   *       tap, since their subject is a real {@code git} talking over a socket this JVM is not on.
   *   <li>{@code qits.githost.storage-client} stays UNSET, which is the shipped compat arm: the
   *       id-addressed scheme then opens to {@code qits:system} and the fixture can provision
   *       through it. Setting it is a different story than any told here.
