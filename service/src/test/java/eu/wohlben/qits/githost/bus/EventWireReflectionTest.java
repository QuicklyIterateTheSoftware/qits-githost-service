/**
 * Guards {@link EventWireReflection} — which is to say, guards the <em>completeness</em> of the
 * registration, because its correctness is not something this suite can reach.
 *
 * <p><b>Say plainly what a JVM test can and cannot prove here.</b> On a JVM every class reflects
 * whether anyone registered it or not, so nothing below would fail if the annotation were deleted
 * tomorrow, except the assertions that read the annotation itself. Only the <b>native artifact</b>,
 * running, proves that the registration does its job. What is written here is the part that IS
 * checkable: that the registered set still covers every type this service's wire path touches, and
 * that the one entry named as a string still resolves. A test pretending to more than that —
 * "native reflection works" asserted in surefire — would pass vacuously and be worse than none.
 *
 * <p>Plain JUnit: nothing here needs a container, and this service registers no listener bean to
 * cross-check the set against (qits-ci's version does, which is the one assertion of its that has
 * no counterpart here).
