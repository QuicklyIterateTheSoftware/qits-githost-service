/**
 * qits-projects, played by a recording {@link MockService} — the far end of the one lookup that
 * makes a PUBLIC clone url serve at all.
 *
 * <p>This host holds no name for any repository: it keys them by the id qits-projects mints, and
 * {@code /git/:projectId/:repoName} works only because {@code HttpRepositoryNameResolver} asks
 * qits-projects to turn the pair into that id, over
 *
 * <pre>
 *   GET &lt;qits.projects.name-resolver-url&gt;/{projectId}/repositories/by-name/{repoName}
 *   200 -&gt; {"repositoryId": "&lt;id&gt;"}
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>So every git story's diagram carries two hops rather than one: the developer reaching this
 * service, and this service reaching qits-projects. The second is <b>observed on the far side</b>
 * — {@link #installSource()} registers the mock's own recording as a {@link NetworkCapture} source,
 * exactly as {@code TokenValidationBootstrapIT} does for the idp — so the story claims nothing and
 * the edge carries the status this side actually answered.
 *
 * <h2>Why the aliases are a fixed table</h2>
 *
 * <p>The stubs must exist before the launched process serves its first request, so they are
 * registered from the {@code QuarkusTestProfile} that hands the process its resolver url. A profile
 * is instantiated in more than one classloader and cannot carry per-run state between them, so the
 * alias table is <b>static</b> and its storage ids are readable literals rather than generated
 * UUIDs. That costs nothing a UUID would buy: {@link StoryOrigin} deletes and recreates each
 * repository before its story, so a fixed id is a repository at a known, empty state rather than
 * whatever a previous build left — and a readable id keeps the browser plane's labels
 * ({@code GET /githost/api/repositories/story-browse -> 200}) legible in the diagram, where a UUID
 * would only ever render as {@code {id}}.
